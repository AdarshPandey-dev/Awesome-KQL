// This KQL query is designed to find and list disabled Azure Active Directory (AAD) accounts. 
// It retrieves account details from the "IdentityInfo" table, filtering for accounts that are disabled 
// based on the "IsAccountEnabled" field. The query then summarizes the results by key account information 
// including display name, email address, department, job title, country, and account status.

// Filtering for disabled accounts (IsAccountEnabled == "0" indicates disabled accounts).
